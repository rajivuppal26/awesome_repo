# Long term goal:
To create an intelligent knowledge base. The knowledge base could potentially take a form similar to a graph database with nodes and relationships that connect those nodes. Similar to how the human brain likely stores information. A possible use case would be to create a knowledge base of business information. As an example, let's say there is public information that 'Company A' has been awarded a $100 million contract by a govâ€™t 'Agency B'. If 'Company A' were to lose that contract it may have significant effect on its stock price, its sub-contractors, its employees etc. If a knowledge base was able to accurately represent the associated entities and the relationships between them, it could prove very useful for many reasons.

## Sub-components:
* #### Knowledge Acquisition:
Acquiring knowledge to populate the knowledge base and appropriately populating it. As Joseph mentioned in the class (4/26) there are two ways of making that happen. Using knowledge engineering and using machine learning or possibly a combination. I am certainly out my depth here on how to make this happen at this stage.
* #### Knowledge base Visualization:
Provide a mechanism to visualize the nodes and connections. For example, being able to see visually that Apple's dependence on Samsung and/or LG for the iPhone screens.

* #### Knowledge base Query:
I have not given this much thought, but there obviously needs to be a mechanism to Query the Knowledge base.

# Short term goal :
1. To create a prototype that allows me to build the 'Knowledge Acquisition' step using NLP (I do not know enough to say how exactly it should be done), in a limited way, and store it in a flat file.
2. To create a prototype that can perform 'Knowledge base Visualization' in a limited way.

## My Concerns:
* Not sure if I have the time and skills to pull this off
 * The last two weeks of the May are going to bit tight for me
   * I have a work trip to San Diego from May 20th to 23rd and
   * I have a trip to Montreal May 28 the to 30th. As a result I will be missing class on May 22nd and 29th
   * To add to the mix, I am likely going to be starting a new job in a couple of weeks
   * It would be great if I can tackle part of this project, because that would give me a chance to learn and put me on a path of taking this project forward after this class is done
* I am looking for your honest feedback
 1. Is the short term goal of creating a prototype, a valid class project?
 2. Is it too ambitious for where I am?

If you guys feel that this may be a bit of a stretch given my time and skill constraints, I will look at other potential project ideas. I really appreciate your time and do want you to know that I am really enjoying the class. I feel that coming out on the other side, I will be able to pursue some of the ideas I have.
Thank you very much.
